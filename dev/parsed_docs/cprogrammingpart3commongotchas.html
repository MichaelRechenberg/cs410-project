What common mistakes do C programmers make?
String literals are character arrays stored in static memory, which is immutable. Two string literals may share the same space in memory. An example follows:
The strings pointed to by str1 and str2 may actually reside in the same location in memory.
Char arrays, however, put that string literal in static memory, and then copy it over to stack memory. These following char arrays do not reside in the same place in memory.
C does not check that pointers are valid. The above example writes into array[10] which is outside the array bounds. This can cause memory corruption because that memory location is probably being used for something else.
In practice, this can be harder to spot because the overflow/underflow may occur in a library call e.g.
Automatic variables are bound to stack memory only for the lifetime of the function.
After the function returns it is an error to continue to use the memory.
In the above example, we needed to allocate enough bytes for the struct. Instead we allocated enough bytes to hold a pointer. Once we start using the user pointer we will corrupt memory. Correct code is show below.
Every string must have a null byte after the last characters. To store the string <code>"Hi"</code> it takes 3 bytes: <code>[H] [i] [\0]</code>.
Automatic variables hold garbage (whatever bit pattern happened to be in memory). It is an error to assume that it will always be initialized to zero.
Automatic (temporary variables) are not automatically initialized to zero.
Heap allocations using malloc are not automatically initialized to zero.
It is an error to free the same block of memory twice.
Pointers to freed memory should not be used. A defensive programming practice is to set pointers to null as soon as the memory is freed.
It is a good idea to turn free into the following snippet that automatically sets the freed variable to null right after:(vim - ultisnips)  
Case statements without a break will just continue onto the code of the next case statement. Correct code is show bellow. The break for the last statements is unnecessary because there are no more cases to be executed after the last one. However if more are added, it can cause some bugs.
The system function 'time' actually takes a parameter (a pointer to some memory that can receive the time_t structure). The compiler did not catch this error because the programmer did not provide a valid function prototype by including time.h
However, the following code is perfectly OK.
It is OK to have this kind of code, because the C language uses semicolons (;) to separate statements. If there is no statement in between semicolons, then there is nothing to do and the compiler moves on to the next statement
Macros are simple text substitution so the above example expands to x++ &lt; 100 ? x++ : 100 (parenthesis omitted for clarity)
Macros are simple text substitution so the above example expands to 10 + 99 &lt; 100 ? 99 : 100
Notice the second line--a = 1 vs. a == 1. What happens here? The assignment operator in C returns the value on the right. So in this case, if (a = 1) evaluates to if (1).
