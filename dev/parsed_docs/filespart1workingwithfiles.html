We've already seen open and fopen (todo link here) so let's look at some more advanced concepts.
For files less than the size of a long using fseek and ftell is a simple way to accomplish this:
Move to the end of the file and find out the current position.
This tells us the current position in the file in bytes - i.e. the length of the file!
fseek can also be used to set the absolute position.
All future reads and writes in the parent or child processes will honor this position.
Note writing or reading from the file will change the current position.
See the man pages for fseek and ftell for more information.
Unlike position, closing a file stream is unique to each process. Other processes can continue to use their own file-handle.
How do I tell how large a file is?
What happens if a child process closes a filestream using fclose or close?
