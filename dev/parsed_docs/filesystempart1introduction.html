The design of a file system is difficult problem because there many high-level design goals that we'd like to satisfy. An incomplete list of ideal goals include:
Not all filesystems natively support all of these goals. For example, many filesystems do not automatically compress rarely-used files
. represents the current directory  
.. represents the parent directory  
... is NOT a valid representation of any directory (this not the grandparent directory)
Absolute paths are paths that start from the 'root node' of your directory tree. Relative paths are paths that start from your current position in the tree.
If you start in your home directory ("~" for short), then Desktop/cs241 would be a relative path. Its absolute path counterpart might be something like /Users/[yourname]/Desktop/cs241.
Remember that .. means 'parent folder' and that . means 'current folder'.
Example: a/b/../c/./
- Step 1: cd a (in a)
- Step 2: cd b (in a/b)
- Step 3: cd .. (in a, because .. represents 'parent folder')
- Step 4: cd c (in a/c)
- Step 5: cd . (in a/c, because . represents 'current folder')
Thus, this path can be simplified to a/c.
To support virtual memory, so we can page stuff in and out of memory.
Some common file permissions include:
* 755: rwx r-x r-x
user: rwx, group: r-x, others: r-x
User can read, write and execute. Group and others can only read and execute.
* 644: rw- r-- r--
user: rw-, group: r--, others: r--
User can read and write. Group and others can only read.
These are examples of permissions in octal format (base 8). Each octal digit corresponds to a different role (user, group, world).
We can read permissions in octal format as follows:
 644 - R/W user permissions, R group permissions, R world permissions
 755 - R/W/X user permissions, R/X group permissions, R/X world permissions
From Wikipedia:
> In a Unix-style file system, an index node, informally referred to as an inode, is a data structure used to represent a filesystem object, which can be one of various things including a file or a directory. Each inode stores the attributes and disk block location(s) of the filesystem object's data. Filesystem object attributes may include manipulation metadata (e.g. change, access, modify time), as well as owner and permission data (e.g. group-id, user-id, permissions).

As a worked example, suppose we divide the disk into 4KB blocks and we want to address up to 2^32 blocks.
The maximum disk size is 4KB *2^32 = 16TB  (remember 2^10 = 1024)
A disk block can store 4KB / 4B (each pointer needs to be 32 bits) = 1024 pointers. Each pointer refers to a 4KB disk block - so you can refer up to 1024*4KB = 4MB of data
For the same disk configuration, a double indirect block stores 1024 pointers to 1024 indirection tables. Thus a double-indirect block can refer up to 1024 * 4MB = 4GB of data.
Similarly, a triple indirect block can refer up to 4TB of data.

Design a file system! What are your design goals?
What are ., .., and ...?
What are absolute and relative paths?
What are some examples of relative and absolute paths?
How do I simplify a/b/../c/./?
Why make disk blocks the same size as memory pages?
What information do we want to store for each file?
What are the traditional permissions: user – group – other permissions for a file?
What are the the 3 permission bits for a regular file for each role?
What do "644" "755" mean?
What is an inode? Which of the above items is stored in the inode?
How does inode store the file contents?
How many pointers can you store in each indirection table?
