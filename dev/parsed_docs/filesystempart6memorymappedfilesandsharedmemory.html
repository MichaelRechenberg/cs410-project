By mapping the files' contents into the address-space of the process.
If many programs only need read-access to the same file (e.g. /bin/bash, the C library) then the same physical memory can be shared between multiple processes.
The same mechanism can be used by programs to directly map files into memory
A simple program to map a file into memory is shown below. The key points to notice are:
 mmap requires a filedescriptor, so we need to open the file first
 We seek to our desired size and write one byte to ensure that the file is sufficient length
* When finished call munmap to unmap the file from memory.
This example also shows the preprocessor constants "LINE" and "FILE" that hold the current line number and filename of the file currently being compiled.
The contents of our binary file can be listed using hexdump
The careful reader may notice that our integers were written in least-significant-byte format (because that is the endianess of the CPU) and that we allocated a file that is one byte too many!
The PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE options specify the virtual memory protection. The option PROT_EXEC (not used here) can be set to allow CPU execution of instructions in memory (e.g. this would be useful if you mapped an executable or library).
For many applications the main advantages are:
Simplified coding - the file data is immediately available. No need to parse the incoming data and store it in new memory structures.
Sharing of files - memory mapped files are particularly efficient when the same data is shared between multiple processes.
Note for simple sequential processing memory mapped files are not necessarily faster than standard 'stream-based' approaches of read / fscanf etc. 
Easy -  Use mmap without a file - just specify the MAP_ANONYMOUS and MAP_SHARED options!
Yes! As a simple example you could reserve just a few bytes and change the value in shared memory when you want the child process to quit.
Sharing memory is a very efficient form of inter-process communication because there is no copying overhead - the two processes literally share the same physical frame of memory.
