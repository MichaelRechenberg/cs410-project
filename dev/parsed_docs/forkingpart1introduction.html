Process forking is a very powerful (and very dangerous) tool. If you mess up and cause a fork bomb (explained later on this page), you can bring down the entire system. To reduce the chances of this, limit your maximum number of processes to a small number e.g
 40 by typing "ulimit -u 40" into a command line.
When testing fork() code, ensure that you have either root and/or physical access to the machine involved. If you must work on fork () code remotely, remember that kill -9 -1 will save you in the event of an emergency.
TL;DR: Fork can be extremely dangerous if you aren't prepared for it. You have been warned.
The fork system call clones the current process to create a new process. It creates a new process (the child process) by duplicating the state of the existing process with a few minor differences (discussed below). The child process does not start from main. Instead it returns from fork() just as the parent process does.
Here's a very simple example...
The following program prints out 42 twice - but the fork() is after the printf!? Why?
The printf line is executed only once however notice that the printed contents is not flushed to standard out (there's no newline printed, we didn't call fflush, or change the buffering mode).
The output text is therefore in still in process memory waiting to be sent.
When fork() is executed the entire process memory is duplicated including the buffer. Thus the child process starts with a non-empty output buffer which will be flushed when the program exits.
Check the return value of fork(). Return value -1= failed; 0= in child process; positive = in parent process (and the return value is the child process id).  Here's one way to remember which is which:
The child process can find its parent - the original process that was duplicated -  by calling getppid() - so does not need any additional return information from fork(). The parent process however can only find out the id of the new child process from the return value of fork:
A 'fork bomb' is when you attempt to create an infinite number of processes. A simple example is shown below:
This will often bring a system to a near-standstill as it attempts to allocate CPU time and memory to a very large number of processes that are ready to run. Comment: System administrators don't like fork-bombs and may set upper limits on the number of processes each user can have or may revoke login rights because it creates a disturbance in the force for other users' programs. You can also limit the number of child processes created by using setrlimit().
fork bombs are not necessarily malicious - they occasionally occur due to student coding errors.
Angrave suggests that the Matrix trilogy, where the machine and man finally work together to defeat the multiplying Agent-Smith, was a cinematic plot based on an AI-driven fork-bomb.
Use waitpid (or wait).
Yes. Use one of the exec functions after forking. The exec set of functions replaces the process image with the the process image of what is being called. This means that any lines of code after the exec call are replaced. Any other work you want the child process to do should be done before the exec call.  
Use system!!! Here is how to use it:
The system call would fork, exec the command passed by parameter and the parent process would wait for this to finish. This also means that system is a blocking call - The parent process can't continue until the process started by system exits. This may be useful or it may not be, use with caution.
A slightly silly example is shown below. What will it print? Try it with multiple arguments to your program.
The amazing parallel apparent-O(N) sleepsort is today's silly winner. First published on 4chan in 2011 . A version of this awful but amusing sorting algorithm is shown below.
The key differences include:
 The process id returned by getpid(). The parent process id returned by getppid().
 The parent is notified via a signal when the child process finishes but not vice versa.
* The child does not inherit pending signals or timer alarms.
For a complete list see the fork man page
Yes! In fact both processes use the same underlying kernel file descriptor. For example if one process rewinds the random access position back to the beginning of the file, then both processes are affected.
Both child and parent should close (or fclose) their file descriptors or file handle respectively.
