The in-browser virtual machine runs entirely in Javascript and is fastest in Chrome. Note the VM and any code you write is reset when you reload the page So copy your code to a separate document
```
Remember the type of a string constant "abc" is an array.
  - Why does this segfault?
C
  char *ptr = "hello";
  *ptr = 'J';
  - What does sizeof("Hello\0World") return?
  - What does strlen("Hello\0World") return?
  - Give an example of X such that sizeof(X) is 3
  - Give an example of Y such at sizeof(Y) might be 4 or 8 depending on the machine.
On a machine where pointers are 8 bytes and with the following code:
C
  char *ptr = "Hello";
  char array[] = "Hello";
  What is the results of sizeof(ptr) and sizeof(array)? Explain why.
