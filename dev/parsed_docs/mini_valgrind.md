## Overview

For this lab, you will be implementing a small version of [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/quick-start.html) called `mini_valgrind`. Valgrind is a great tool for monitoring memory usage, and you have likely used it earlier in this class. Your version will print out a summary of the memory leaks in a particular C program. This lab is meant in part as preparation for your Malloc MP, introducing some topics and techniques which you will find helpful there.

## Main Concepts

The main concept of this lab is that we can track each block of memory using some extra space before each allocation (called *metadata*). We have provided you with a struct `meta_data` in `mini_valgrind.h`. The metadata is set up as a linked list of nodes which store information for each allocated block. Each node stores the amount of memory requested, the filename and location of the instruction that made the request, and a pointer to the next allocated block.

Here's an illustration:

When the program is about to exit, we can look at this metadata list to see what the user hasn't freed. These are your memory leaks.

If you feel that you need a refresher on linked lists or other prerequisite concepts, feel free to ask a CA or TA one-on-one.

## mini_valgrind.c

We have set up `mini_valgrind` to dynamically replace every call to `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free` in the user's program with a call to the corresponding function below, which you will implement.

Inside of `mini_valgrind.c`, it is safe to call the real versions of `malloc` and related functions. You should *not* be writing your own implementation of `malloc` using `sbrk` or related system calls.

### mini_malloc

`mini_malloc` wraps a call to `malloc`. It will not only allocate the user-requested space, but will also allocate and set up metadata to track each block of memory. You should do this with a single call to `malloc`.

Consult the header file `mini_valgrind.h` for more details.

### mini_calloc

`mini_calloc` wraps a call to `calloc`. It works mostly the same way as `malloc`, allocating memory for `num_elments` each of size `element_size`, but also sets each byte of memory to zero.

You can use your `mini_malloc` here, or call `calloc` directly.

### mini_realloc

`mini_realloc` wraps a call to `realloc`, which resizes an existing block of memory. The basic logic for `realloc` is if the given pointer is not NULL, then you will need to either grow or shrink the block of memory it points to and update its metadata. If the pointer is NULL, then `realloc` is the same as `malloc`.

### mini_free

`mini_free` wraps a call to `free`. In addition to freeing the block of memory, you should also remove it from the metadata list.

Your `mini_free` shouldn't crash when passed an invalid pointer! This is different from the typical behavior of `free`. Instead, you should increment the `invalid_addresses` global variable. Invalid pointers include pointers that you did not return from `mini_malloc` (or `mini_calloc`, or `mini_realloc`) and double frees. Note that NULL is _not_ an invalid pointer.

### Global Variables

As you implement the functions above, you'll need to maintain the following global variables:

* `total_memory_requested`: stores the total number of bytes of memory requested by the user throughout the lifetime of the program (excluding metadata)

* `total_memory_freed`: stores the total number of bytes of memory freed by the user throughout the lifetime of the program

* `invalid_addresses`: stores the number of times the user has tried to `realloc` or `free` an invalid pointer

To find the amount of memory the user is leaking, we just need to subtract `total_memory_freed` from `total_memory_requested`.

## Testing

You'll want to test your `mini_valgrind` throughly.

We've provided you with a `test.c` file that you can put test cases in. Running `make` will generate a `./test` executable alongside `mini_valgrind`. You can use it like the regular Valgrind:

    ./mini_valgrind ./test

The output should look familiar!

Note that we always build `./test` with debugging symbols (`gcc -g`), so `mini_valgrind` can find the line numbers corresponding to memory leaks.

To debug `mini_valgrind` itself, you can use `gdb` like usual. Use `make debug` to generate a version of `mini_valgrind` with debugging symbols:

    gdb --args ./mini_valgrind-debug ./test

You can also run `mini_valgrind` on other programs. Just be aware that it won't work on everything. You'll notice it will generate different output than Valgrind or may even crash when run on complex software like `python`. _This is okay; writing a memory checker is hard!_ You only need to implement what we've described above and in `mini_valgrind.h`.

## Example

Here's a basic test case to check your progress.

Say you had the following in your `test.c` file:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
int main() {
    void *p1 = malloc(30);
    void *p2 = malloc(40);
    void *p3 = malloc(50);
    free(p2);
    return 0;
}
```

`mini_valgrind`'s output should look like this (of course, your process ID will be different):

```
==25219== Mini-Valgrind
==25219==
==25219== LEAK REPORT:
==25219==    Leak origin: main (test.c:5)
==25219==    Leak size: 50 bytes
==25219==    Leak memory address: 0x1009790
==25219==
==25219==    Leak origin: main (test.c:3)
==25219==    Leak size: 30 bytes
==25219==    Leak memory address: 0x10096f0
==25219==
==25219== Program made 0 bad call(s) to free or realloc.
==25219==
==25219== HEAP SUMMARY:
==25219==    Total memory requested: 120 bytes
==25219==    Total memory freed: 40 bytes
==25219==    Total leak: 80 bytes
```

Notice that leaks are reported most-recent-first. This is because we insert new metadata at the head of the linked list.

## Behind the Scenes

This section describes some details of how we've implemented `mini_valgrind`. You are encouraged, but not required, to understand this.

We compile your `mini_` functions, along with some extra code from `mini_hacks.c`, into a [_shared object_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_%28computing%29#Shared_libraries) called `mini_valgrind.so`.

`mini_hacks.c` has two main jobs:

- Create wrappers around `malloc` and the other functions to make sure they use your replacement functions when the user's program calls them, while still letting you use the real versions within your code
- Print out leak info at program exit

The actual `./mini_valgrind` program is implemented in `mini_main.c`. When you run `./mini_valgrind ./test`, we use an environment variable called [`LD_PRELOAD`](https://rafalcieslak.wordpress.com/2013/04/02/dynamic-linker-tricks-using-ld_preload-to-cheat-inject-features-and-investigate-programs/) to run the `./test` program using the code in `mini_valgrind.so`. Essentially, it replaces normal references to the built-in `malloc` with references to our version.

_"But,"_ you may ask, _"how do we call the real version of `malloc` if we've replaced it with our own version of it?"_ The trick is a function called [`dlsym`](https://linux.die.net/man/3/dlsym), which allows us to bypass `LD_PRELOAD` and ask for a function pointer to the real `malloc`. This is all handled within `mini_hacks.c`.
