There are a variety of function calls available to send UDP sockets. We will use the newer getaddrinfo to help set up a socket structure.
Remember that UDP is a simple packet-based ('data-gram') protocol ; there is no connection to set up between the two hosts.
First, initialize the hints addrinfo struct to request an IPv6, passive datagram socket.
Next, use getaddrinfo to specify the port number (we don't need to specify a host as we are creating a server socket, not sending a packet to a remote host).
The port number is <1024, so the program will need root privileges. We could have also specified a service name instead of a numeric port value.
So far the calls have been similar to a TCP server. For a stream-based service we would call listen and accept. For our UDP-serve we can just start waiting for the arrival of a packet on the socket-
The addr struct will hold sender (source) information about the arriving packet.
Note the sockaddr_storage type is a sufficiently large enough to hold all possible types of socket addresses (e.g. IPv4, IPv6 and other socket types).
