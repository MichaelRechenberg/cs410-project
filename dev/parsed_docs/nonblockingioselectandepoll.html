Normally, when you call read(), if the data is not available yet it will wait until the data is ready before the function returns.  When you're reading data from a disk, that delay may not be long, but when you're reading from a slow network connection it may take a long time for that data to arrive, if it ever arrives.  
POSIX lets you set a flag on a file descriptor such that any call to read() on that file descriptor will return immediately, whether it has finished or not.  With your file descriptor in this mode, your call to read() will start
the read operation, and while it's working you can do other useful work.  This is called "nonblocking" mode,
since the call to read() doesn't block.
To set a file descriptor to be nonblocking:
For a socket, you can create it in nonblocking mode by adding SOCK_NONBLOCK to the second argument to socket():
When a file is in nonblocking mode and you call read(), it will return immediately with whatever bytes are available.
Say 100 bytes have arrived from the server at the other end of your socket and you call read(fd, buf, 150).
Read will return immediately with a value of 100, meaning it read 100 of the 150 bytes you asked for.
Say you tried to read the remaining data with a call to read(fd, buf+100, 50), but the last 50 bytes still hadn't
arrived yet.  read() would return -1 and set the global error variable errno to either
EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK.  That's the system's way of telling you the data isn't ready yet.
write() also works in nonblocking mode.  Say you want to send 40,000 bytes to a remote server using a socket.
The system can only send so many bytes at a time. Common systems can send about 23,000 bytes at a time. In nonblocking mode, write(fd, buf, 40000) would return the number of bytes it was able to
send immediately, or about 23,000.  If you called write() right away again, it would return -1 and set errno to
EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK. That's the system's way of telling you it's still busy sending the last chunk of data,
and isn't ready to send more yet.
There are a few ways.  Let's see how to do it using select and epoll.
Given three sets of file descriptors, select() will wait for any of those file descriptors to become 'ready'.
 readfds - a file descriptor in readfds is ready when there is data that can be read or EOF has been reached.
 writefds - a file descriptor in writefds is ready when a call to write() will succeed.
* exceptfds - system-specific, not well-defined.  Just pass NULL for this.
select() returns the total number of file descriptors that are ready.  If none of them become
ready during the time defined by timeout, it will return 0.  After select() returns, the 
caller will need to loop
through the file descriptors in readfds and/or writefds to see which ones are ready.

epoll is not part of POSIX, but it is supported by Linux.  It is a more efficient way to wait for many
file descriptors.  It will tell you exactly which descriptors are ready. It even gives you a way to store
a small amount of data with each descriptor, like an array index or a pointer, making it easier to access
your data associated with that descriptor.
To use epoll, first you must create a special file descriptor with epoll_create().  You won't read or write to this file
descriptor; you'll just pass it to the other epoll_xxx functions and call
close() on it at the end.
For each file descriptor you want to monitor with epoll, you'll need to add it 
to the epoll data structures 
using epoll_ctl() with the EPOLL_CTL_ADD option.  You can add any
number of file descriptors to it.
To wait for some of the file descriptors to become ready, use epoll_wait().
The epoll_event struct that it fills out will contain the data you provided in event.data when you
added this file descriptor. This makes it easy for you to look up your own data associated
with this file descriptor.
Say you were waiting to write data to a file descriptor, but now you want to wait to read data from it.
Just use epoll_ctl() with the EPOLL_CTL_MOD option to change the type of operation you're monitoring.
To unsubscribe one file descriptor from epoll while leaving others active, use epoll_ctl() with the EPOLL_CTL_DEL option.
To shut down an epoll instance, close its file descriptor.
In addition to nonblocking read() and write(), any calls to connect() on a nonblocking socket will also be
nonblocking. To wait for the connection to complete, use select() or epoll to wait for the socket to be writable.
