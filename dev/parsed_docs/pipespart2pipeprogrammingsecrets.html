Here's a complete example that doesn't work! The child reads one byte at a time from the pipe and prints it out - but we never see the message! Can you see why?
The parent sends the bytes H,i,(space),C...! into the pipe (this may block if the pipe is full).
The child starts reading the pipe one byte at a time. In the above case, the child process will read and print each character. However it never leaves the while loop! When there are no characters left to read it simply blocks and waits for more. The call putchar writes the characters out but we never flush the buffer.
To see the message we could flush the buffer (e.g. fflush(stdout) or printf("\n"))
or better, let's look for the end of message '!'
And the message will be flushed to the terminal when the child process exits.
POSIX file descriptors are simple integers 0,1,2,3...
At the C library level, C wraps these with a buffer and useful functions like printf and scanf, so we that we can easily print or parse integers, strings etc.
If you already have a file descriptor then you can 'wrap' it yourself into a FILE pointer using fdopen :
For writing to files this is unnecessary - just use fopen which does the same as open and fdopen
However for pipes, we already have a file descriptor - so this is great time to use fdopen!
Here's a complete example using pipes that almost works! Can you spot the error? Hint: The parent never prints anything!
Note the (unnamed) pipe resource will disappear once both the child and parent have exited. In the above example the child will send the bytes and the parent will receive the bytes from the pipe. However, no end-of-line character is ever sent, so fscanf will continue to ask for bytes because it is waiting for the end of the line i.e. it will wait forever! The fix is to ensure we send a newline character, so that fscanf will return.
So do we need to fflush too?
Yes, if you want your bytes to be sent to the pipe immediately! At the beginning of this course we assumed that file streams are always line buffered i.e. the C library will flush its buffer everytime you send a newline character. Actually this is only true for terminal streams - for other filestreams the C library attempts to improve performance by only flushing when it's internal buffer is full or the file is closed.
If you need to send data to and from a child asynchronously, then two pipes are required (one for each direction).
Otherwise the child would attempt to read its own data intended for the parent (and vice versa)!
Processes receive the signal SIGPIPE when no process is listening! From the pipe(2) man page - 
Tip: Notice only the writer (not a reader) can use this signal.
To inform the reader that a writer is closing their end of the pipe, you could write your own special byte (e.g. 0xff) or a message ( "Bye!")
Here's an example of catching this signal that does not work! Can you see why?
The mistake in above code is that there is still a reader for the pipe! The child still has the pipe's first file descriptor open and remember the specification? All readers must be closed.
When forking, It is common practice to close the unnecessary (unused) end of each pipe in the child and parent process. For example the parent might close the reading end and the child might close the writing end (and vice versa if you have two pipes)
Unnamed pipes (the kind we've seen up to this point) live in memory (do not take up any disk space) and are a simple and efficient form of inter-process communication (IPC) that is useful for streaming data and simple messages. Once all processes have closed, the pipe resources are freed.
An alternative to unamed pipes is named pipes created using mkfifo - more about these in a future lecture.
