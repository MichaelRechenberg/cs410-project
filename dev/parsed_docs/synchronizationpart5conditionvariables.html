 "Only one process(/thread) can be in the CS at a time"
 "If waiting, then another process can only enter the CS a finite number of times" 
* "If no other process is in the CS then the process can immediately enter the CS"

The exchange instruction ('XCHG') is an atomic CPU instruction that exchanges the contents of a register with a memory location. This can be used as a basis to implement a simple mutex lock.
Condition variables allow a set of threads to sleep until tickled! You can tickle one thread or all threads that are sleeping. If you only wake one thread then the operating system will decide which thread to wake up. You don't wake threads directly instead you 'signal' the condition variable, which then will wake up one (or all) threads that are sleeping inside the condition variable.
Condition variables are used with a mutex and with a loop (to check a condition).
Occasionally a waiting thread may appear to wake up for no reason (this is called a spurious wake)! This is not an issue because you always use wait inside a loop that tests a condition that must be true to continue.
Threads sleeping inside a condition variable are woken up calling pthread_cond_broadcast (wake up all) or pthread_cond_signal (wake up one). Note despite the function name, this has nothing to do with POSIX signals!
The call pthread_cond_wait performs three actions:
 unlock the mutex and atomically...
 waits (sleeps until pthread_cond_signal is called on the same condition variable)
* Before returning, locks the mutex
Condition variables need a mutex for three reasons. The simplest to understand is that it prevents an early wakeup message (signal or broadcast functions) from being 'lost.' Imagine the following sequence of events (time runs down the page) where the condition is satisfied just before pthread_cond_wait is called. In this example the wake-up signal is lost!
If both threads had locked a mutex, the signal can not be sent until after pthread_cond_wait(cv, m) is called (which then internally unlocks the mutex)
A second common reason is that updating the program state (answer variable) typically requires mutual exclusion - for example multiple threads may be updating the value of answer.
A third and subtle reason is to satisfy real-time scheduling concerns which we only outline here: In a time-critical application, the waiting thread with the highest priority should be allowed to continue first. To satisfy this requirement the mutex must also be locked before calling pthread_cond_signal or pthread_cond_broadcast . For the curious, a longer and historical discussion is here.
For performance. On multi-CPU systems it is possible that a race-condition could cause a wake-up (signal) request to be unnoticed. The kernel may not detect this lost wake-up call but can detect when it might occur. To avoid the potential lost signal the thread is woken up so that the program code can test the condition again.
Condition variables are always used with a mutex lock.
Before calling wait, the mutex lock must be locked and wait must be wrapped with a loop.
Implement sem_init to initialize the mutex and condition variable
Our implementation of sem_post needs to increment the count.
We will also wake up any threads sleeping inside the condition variable.
Notice we lock and unlock the mutex so only one thread can be inside the critical section at a time.
Our implementation of sem_wait may need to sleep if the semaphore's count is zero.
Just like sem_post we wrap the critical section using the lock (so only one thread can be executing our code at a time). Notice if the thread does need to wait then the mutex will be unlocked, allowing another thread to enter sem_post and waken us from our sleep!
Notice that even if a thread is woken up, before it returns from  pthread_cond_wait it must re-acquire the lock, so it will have to wait a little bit more (e.g. until sem_post finishes). 
Wait sem_post keeps calling pthread_cond_signal won't that break sem_wait? 
Answer: No! We can't get past the loop until the count is non-zero. In practice this means sem_post would unnecessary call pthread_cond_signal even if there are no waiting threads. A more efficient implementation would only call pthread_cond_signal when necessary i.e.
